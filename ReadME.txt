Face recognition Using KNN

The source code is divided into two python files namely 'new_face.py' and 'face_recognition.py'.

Dataset for the project has to be manually stored by running the 'new_face.py' file.

Before executing the code a new folder named 'data' has to be created in the same directory in which
the user is executing the code. This folder will contain the haar cascade .xml document which 
will be necessary for face detection.

Once the 'new_face.py' is executed and the name associated with the face is stored , two new files
namely 'faces.pkl' and 'names.pkl' gets created in the 'data' directory. These two files forms our database.

To perform the face recognition run the 'face_recognition.py' file.
